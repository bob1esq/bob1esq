<!--
**bob1esq/bob1esq** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

-    Iâ€™m currently working on a start up business that will eliminate multi-party wage and hour lawsuits in California
-   I am a California emploment law lawyer who also worked as CEO for a manufacturing plant for 12 years.
- Iâ€™m currently learning coding, but have a very long way to go
-  Iâ€™m looking for a business partner who knows how to code time keeping software
- Problems business will cure:<div><br>
      1. Over 95% of employers in Califoria are out of compliance with the wage and hour laws. <div><br> 
      2.  Most employers want to comply with the law, but find it too complex to know or enforce <div> <br>
      3.  The wage and hour lawsuits are usually multi-party (on behalf of all emplpyees) and are so expensive <div>
      that employers are often required to close their doors or move out of state if sued <div><br>
      4.  No other software or time keeping program solves this problem.
- ðŸ’¬ How to cure the problem <div><div>
      1.  I have created interactive legal forms that will cure the problem by ensuring compliance <div><br>
      2.  The interaction (which will cure the problem) will take less than a minute per employee per day.
